# Dependencies

The `jsonnet-eval` method depends on the `jsonnet` binary, which should be
available on your `exec-path`. Install this on OSX with Homebrew by running
`brew install jsonnet`.

# Features

## Indentation

The indentation rules are a set of rules which I put together based on my
experience with Jsonnet. You can see them by looking at the implementation of
`jsonnet-calculate-indent`.

## Formatting

Closely related to indentation is formatting. By running
`jsonnet-reformat-buffer` (bound to `C-c C-r`), the `jsonnet fmt` utility will
reformat your buffer and make it pretty.

## Rendering

To get a snapshot of what your Jsonnet file will render to, run `jsonnet-eval`
(bound to `C-c C-e`). This will popup another window and show the result of
running `jsonnet-command` on the current buffer.

## Navigation

`jsonnet-mode` also provides some methods to make navigation easier. In
particular, `jsonnet-jump` (bound to `C-c C-f`) allows you to jump to the
definition of a given identifier.

# Configuration

There are three customizable parameters that you may configure in this mode:

- `jsonnet-command` allows you to indicate which Jsonnet binary should be used to render a JSON document.
- `jsonnet-library-search-directories` specifies the sequence of Jsonnet library search directories use during evaluation.  
  Relative paths in this sequence must resolve from the directory of the buffer being evaluated.
- `jsonnet-enable-debug-print` will cause methods in jsonnet-mode to write messages to the status bar if enabled.
